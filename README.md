# Disruptive-Data-Summer-School

Davide Bianchi's test to access the Disruptive Data Summer School. The test is done in jupyter notebook with where is possible to find a step-by-step description and executable python code.

# My presentation
I am a theoretical physicist by formation (bachelor and master degree in Univeristy of Rome La Sapienza) but I do believe that physics and maths need to find real world problem to tackle. For this reason I first focused on biophysics, my master degree dissertation is about modelling bacteria's methabolism, and then joined the CANES program in King's College London. The CANES program aims to do just what I like: apply math and physics to multiple disciplines in a collaboration environment. Thanks to this program I degreed in Non-equilibrium systems and I am, since one year, working on my PhD in Computer Science. I am currently working on complex adaptative systems. 
My interest for this summer school has a double purpouse:
1. During my research I run simulations that produce a good amount of data and I would like to improve my data analysis techniques
2. I am already almost sure that after completing my PhD I would like to work in industry using cutting edge techniques to solve problems. I believe that being a Data Scientist could be the right path.
